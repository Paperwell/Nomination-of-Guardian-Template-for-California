#NOMINATION OF GUARDIANS

We, [PARENT 1] and [PARENT 2], declare as follows:

1) **Family Information.**  We are married and have one (1) minor child, [MINOR 1].  We are currently expecting our second child.

2) **Nomination of Guardians.**  Upon the death of the survivor of us, if any of our children are minors, we nominate the following guardians:

>A) **Guardians of the Person**.  We nominate [GUARDIAN 1] and [GUARDIAN 2], or the survivor of them, as guardians of the person of each of our minor children.  If both [GUARDIAN 1] and [GUARDIAN 2] are unable or unwilling to serve, we nominate [GUARDIAN 3] and [GUARDIAN 4], or the survivor of them, to serve as guardians of the person of our minor children.

>B) **Guardians of the Estate**.  We nominate [GUARDIAN 1] as guardian of the estate of each of our minor children.  If [GUARDIAN 1] is unable or unwilling to serve, we nominate [GUARDIAN 5] to serve as guardian of the estate of our minor children.

>C) **Application of this Declaration**.  The term “Guardian of the Person” refers to the person appointed by the court to serve as guardian of the person of each of our minor children.  The term “Guardian of the Estate” refers to the person appointed by the court to serve as guardian of the estate of each of our minor children.  
 References to the “Guardian” or “Guardians” refer to both the Guardian of the Person and the Guardian of the Estate.  The provisions apply to the initial Guardians and to each successor Guardian appointed by the court.

3) **Waiver of Bond**.  We request that no bond be required of any Guardian that we nominate.

4) **Scope of Responsibility**.  The Guardian of the Person will have physical and legal custody of our minor children.  The Guardian of the Person will also make all decisions relating to the health and education of our minor children.  The Guardian of the Estate will hold, administer, and distribute the assets owned by our minor children (excluding all assets held in trust for their benefit).  The Guardian of the Estate, after consultation with the Guardian of the Person, will make all decisions relating to the expenditure of our children’s assets for their health, education, support, maintenance, and welfare (their “needs”).

5) **Support of Minor Children**.  We have created trusts for our minor children to provide funds for our minor children’s needs after our deaths.  We anticipate that the assets available for our children will be sufficient to enable them to continue to enjoy the standard of living to which they were accustomed during our lifetimes.  The Guardians should not use the Guardians’ own assets for our children’s needs unless the Guardian has a legal obligation to provide for our children.  The Guardians should request funds from the trustees of the children’s trusts, and the Guardians should use any other assets available to our children outside their trusts.

6) **Health Insurance**.  We request that the Guardians maintain health insurance coverage for our minor children, if insurance coverage is available.  The trustees should pay the cost of the insurance from the children’s trusts, or the Guardians can pay the costs from the children’s assets outside the trusts.  The Guardian of the Person may purchase health insurance coverage for his or her entire family including our children, and the trustees of the Guardian of the Estate can reimburse the Guardian of the Person for our children’s share of the cost.

7) **Residence of Minor Children**.  We want our children to be raised together as a family unit.  The Guardian of the Person has discretion to determine where our children will reside, and the Guardian may move our children to any place of residence within or outside California.

8) **Guardian May Live in Residence Owned by Children**.  The Guardian of the Person nominated by this document and his or her family may also live with our children during the term of the guardianship in any residence owned by our children or held in trust for their benefit.  The Guardian of the Person and his or her family should pay a reasonable portion of the mortgage, utilities, property taxes, insurance, and maintenance expenses during the time that they reside in the residence.

9) **Contact with Our Family Members**.  We believe that frequent and continuing association between our children and both of our families is in the best interests of our children.  We want our children to have frequent and continuing contact with both of our families and the Guardian of the Person is directed to work toward that end.

10) **Access to Information for and Consultation with Family Members**.  The Guardians should share important information concerning our children with our family members, including the children’s medical condition, educational training, extracurricular activities, and moral and religious training.
 
11) **Prior Nominations**.  We revoke any prior nominations of guardians we have made.  The nominations stated in this declaration will supersede the nominations of guardians stated in [PARENT 1]’s or [PARENT 2]’s wills or in any other document we executed prior to the date stated below.

We declare under penalty of perjury under the law of California that the foregoing is true and correct.

Executed on January 15th, 2012, at Sacramento, California.
